## Space Complexity Report

Overall, the worst-case space complexity for my solution would be O (n), owing to the number of loops that loop through the numbers given by the user. in order to calculate the ISBN.

Given the task at hand, I believe that a space complexity of O(n) is one of the better options because it allows me to avoid using nested for loops. Each of the four for loops is only triggered once, depending on the users' input.

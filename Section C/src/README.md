## Installation 

 * In order to run this program you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a IDE in this case we will be using IntelliJ.
 * Below I will include instructions for installing JDK and IntelliJ to get it setup and allow you to run the program.
   * Firstly for IntelliJ to work we will need to install JDK. Below will be instructions for that.
     * Click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to go to the JDK download page then download the installer for your Operating System (OS).
     * Once it has been downloaded run the installer and follow the installers instructions, After the installation is finished you can click close.
     * You can find a full guide on how to install JDK [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A__INSTALLINGTHEJDKANDJREONMICROSOFTWI-E04E8B17)
     * Next lets confirm that JDK has been installed correctly, to do so type the following into the command-line/terminal.
     * *java --version* and you should see something similar to whats below
     
       ```
       java 17.0.2 2022-01-18 LTS
       Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86)
       Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86, mixed mode, sharing)
       ```
     * Do the same for *javac --version*
     
       ```
       javac 17.0.2
       ```
       
  * Now that JDK has been installed correctly we can now install IntelliJ clicking [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=windows) for the download page then download the community version for your OS.
  
    ![Download the community version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98963869/152643639-396bad1c-0995-43c9-98e0-45c2363f30b7.png)
    
    * Once it has been downloaded run the installer to download IntelliJ.
  
  * IntelliJ and JDK should both now be installed on your computer and you can now download or clone the program from github saving it somewhere you can find later.

* Now that you should have the project files setup and opened within IntelliJ, you can now navigate through to the section you wish to view.
* Next you will have to setup JDK for the project, in order to do navigate through *Section C* to *src* to *main* then finally click on *ISBNValidator.java*.
  * You should now have screen similar to below.![Screenshot (58)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98963869/170743796-069ec750-87e8-47b6-b369-557f03b6d755.png)
